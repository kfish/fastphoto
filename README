FastPhoto
=========

FastPhoto is a high-performance rescaling tool for photographic images. It
can be installed on a web server as a handler for files of type image/jpeg,
providing fast server-side resizing with (optional) transparent caching. It
can also be used as a commandline application.

FastPhoto uses Epeg, a high-performance JPEG resizing library which decodes
only the DCT coefficients needed to reconstruct an image of the desired size,
and avoids colorspace conversions where possible.

FastPhoto preserves the aspect of the original file unless both width and
height options are specified. 

Usage
