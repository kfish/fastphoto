This is a loosely-categorized list of outstanding tasks and ideas for improving
fastphoto. When implementing any of these, please include an update to this TODO
file removing that task, in the same commit.

* Pull epeg.c direction into fastphoto, as libepeg is no longer maintained upstream.
(JPEG load/save has been pulled directly into Evas, but an Evas backend would be
slow as it always goes via RGB).

* Horms reported a problem with passing negative values to epeg_decode_size_set():
	it produces a 1x1 puce colored image. Test if this is fixed in libepeg, in
	any case guard against negative values.

* Test with libjpeg-turbo: see
