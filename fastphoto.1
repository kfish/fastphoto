.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fastphoto
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Rescale JPEG image files.
.PP
fastphoto is a high-performance rescaling tool for photographic images. It
can be installed on a web server as a handler for files of type image/jpeg,
providing fast server-side resizing with (optional) transparent caching.
.PP
fastphoto uses libepeg, a high-performance JPEG resizing library which
decodes only the DCT coefficients needed to reconstruct an image of the
desired size, and avoids colorspace conversions (unless converting color
images to grayscale).
